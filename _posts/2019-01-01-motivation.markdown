So here we are! It's on, it's working and it's fresh and crunchy. Mhh, feels so good. Yes, I'm talking about the long-awaited idea of creating a blog which was sitting on my TODO list long ago. 

> All knowledge is connected to all other knowledge. The fun is in making the connections.

I think you got the idea, I see this blog as a connection between mine and others knowledge. 

So deep, right? 

## Okay, but WHAT are you going to blog about?
In my previous years I was very lucky to work with bright people who were using F# as a main or side language on projects. As a C# engineer I was a bit refusing against the *functional paradigms* first - which is really funny to think about now - but with time, my brain started to consume the idea bits by bits and it's just *clicked*.

After ~2 years of using F#, reading and learning about everything what I could and using  the language heavily, I feel ready to share my current and further experiences. Also, I would like to give back something to the F# community and to *others*, so most of the blog posts are going to be written in F# and maybe some in C#, we will see.

Our infrastructure is based on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), given I work on the backend side you can expect some [Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) with [Serverless](https://serverless.com/).

## Why?

Let's finally talk about the main purpose of the post. Why and most importantly, what are my motivations?

I believe blogging is one of the best solutions to give some visibilty about my work, share my passion and share the feeling of figuring out some hard problem.

Motivations:
- My main priority is to share the experience, pain points, interesting parts of my daily work with my collegaues (I referred them as *others* above) who work in different teams on different problems with different languages. So, basically with every developer :)

- My memory is really short so will be definitely useful to create a stash of my achievements.

- The team what I'm working in, just wanted something what is going to make us able to share our [*"professional mojo"*](http://austinpowers.wikia.com/wiki/Mojo).

- Given my mother tongue is not English, it gives me a good opportunity to widen my vocabulary and fix my grammar where it's needed.

- Make Alex happy about something in the new year. He kept reminding me day by day about my TODO item on my small whiteboard. Thank you Sir!

Can't wait to write my very first technical post, so keep calm, interesting functional stuffs are coming!
